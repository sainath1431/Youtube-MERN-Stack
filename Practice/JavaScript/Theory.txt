Introduction :

-JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

-JavaScript is the programming language of the web.

-JavaScript and java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.

-JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 , and became an ECMA Standard in 1997.

-ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.


Variables Declaration

- There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variables.
1. Using var.
2. Using let.
3. Using const.

- All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.

Statement

-A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

-In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statments.

- A JavaScript program is a list of programming statments.

-EX : 
    let x, y, z; //Statement 1
    x = 5;       //Statement 2   
    y = 6;       //Statement 3
    z = x + y;   //Statement 4

Output  :

JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

* Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
* Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
* Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
* Writing into the browser console, using console.log().


Data Types :

* A data type is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.

* In JavaScript we do have datatypes like :
1) Number 
2) String
3) Arrays
4) Objects.

1) Numbers  : 

* JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals. EX :

let x = 3.14; // A number with decimals.
let y = 3; // A number without decimals.

* Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript does not define different types of numbers, like integers, short, lon, floating-point etc.

* JavaScript numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers.

* Number Methods.
